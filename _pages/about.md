# About Me

I am a PhD Student at the [University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB)](https://www.cs.ucsb.edu/) co-advised by Professors [Elizabeth Belding](https://sites.cs.ucsb.edu/~ebelding/) and [Arpit Gupta](https://sites.cs.ucsb.edu/~gupta/). My current interest lies at the intersection of computer networks, internet measurement, and machine learning, further supported by my receipt of the [NSF Graduate Research Fellowship (GRFP)](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/). I aim to build large-scale and scalable systems that have practical applications in both industry and academia.

My overall goal is to study the three critical dimensions of internet broadband: availability, affordability, and quality. I have explored broadband availability through my [SIGCOMM'24 paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3603269.3604837) on assessing ISP deployment in the United States. Currently, I am working on characterizing broadband quality using foundation models and speed test measurements.

For more about my work in data-driven policymaking, visit our [project webpage](https://address.cs.ucsb.edu/).

Feel free to explore my work, and donâ€™t hesitate to reach out for collaborations or discussions!
