About Me
======
I am a PhD Student at the University of California, Santa Barbara co-adviced by Professors Elizabeth Belding and Arpit Gupta. My current interest lies on the intersection of computer networks and internet measurement with machine learning which is furthered by my reciept of the NSF Graduate Fellowship. I build large scale and scalable systems that can be of prcatical use both in the industry and academia.

My overall goal is to delve into the 3 dimensions of internet broadband that is broadband availability, affordability and quality. I have delved into quality through my SIGCOMM'24 paper on assessing ISP deployment in America. I am presently working on charecterizing broadband quality through foundation models and speed test measurements.
