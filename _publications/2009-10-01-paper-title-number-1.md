excerpt: ' In this article, a novel time-frequency (TF) domain deep learning approach is proposed for the automated detection of atrial fibrillation (AF) using multi-lead ECG signals. The wavelet-based synchrosqueezing transform (WSST) is used to evaluate the TF image of each lead ECG signal. Furthermore, the modified vision transformer (ViT) model detects AF arrhythmia using the WSST-based TF images of the three best lead ECG signals. The proposed approach is tested using a public databaseâ€™s multi-lead ECG time series. The results reveal that the suggested WSST-based modified ViT model has obtained the accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score values of 95.50%, 93.36%, 98.00%, and 0.957, respectively.'
